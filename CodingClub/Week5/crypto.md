## What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the creating and breaking of secret codes.
Spies use cryptography to keep national secrets safe!  
You can think of it sort of like passing secrete notes that you can only understand if you know the secret language.  
In cybersecurity, it's used to keep your data safe and secure.  
Every bug company uses cryptography to protect data, from Facebook to Amazon to Google.  
Even small businesses use cryptography.

## Cybersecurity and Cryptography

Cryptography is a pillar to Cybersecurity. Without secret codes to keep your data private, 
there would be no cybersecurity.  
Ciphers are one method used in cryptography (we will be focusing on ciphers).  
Hashes are another method in cryptography.  
Without Cryptography there would be no internet, since the world runs on secret codes!  

## The Caesar Cipher

The **Caesar Cipher** was invented by Julius Caesar to protect military secrets of the Roman Empire. 
It was one of the first ciphers ever invented!

### What is the Caesar Cipher?

- Essentially a shift
- Plaintext(Regular) alphabet and Cipher(Code) alphabet in alphabetical order
- We'll try an example with a 19 letter shift

- Line up the letter "A" on the inside circle (this represents your plain text alphabet) with the letter "T" on the outside circle (this represents your cipher alphabet.

Let's try and decode this Caesar Cipher. The answer will tell us something that is happening soon.

Start by finding the first letter of the code, "Z", on your big circle. Then, write down the letter on the small circle that is lined up with the "Z" on your outside circle. To give you a hint, the first letter should be an "S". Now, all you have to do is keep repeating this for each letter of the message and then you will know what the secret message is. 

Now, you can try to crack this code on your own. The answer will tell you the name of another old cipher.

Feel free to take a break here and practice writing your own codes using the wheel. You can practice writing your name, your school, your favorite ice cream flavor, or anything you want. If you're eager, try to teach a sibling, parent, or friend how to use your wheel to crack Caesar Ciphers and practice writing secret messages to each other!

### How Do You Solve a Caesar Cipher?

In order to use the Caesar wheel to crack codes, you need to know the size of the shift. Most of the time, you don't know the size of the shift. No worries, we can still solve these codes, it just takes a little more thinking. Here are some helpful hints on how to crack Caesar Ciphers:  
- Look for a hint, like...
  - Single letter words (I & A)
  - Likely words you have most of the letters for
  - 2 letter words (in, on, no, of, so, to, etc.)
  - Name or place that you know is in the cipher
- Utilize letter frequency

Remember, once you have 1 letter figured out, you can line it up on your wheel and you now have a key to decipher the whole code.

### Practice!

Now that you've learned about Caesar Ciphers and how to decode them, head to [this link](https://learnification.fun/) for more practice.
Log in using any eamil account you or your parents have to save your progress. 
Then click on the menu button in the top left corner, and click on bathroom ciphers. 
This will take you through a few examples of Caesar Ciphers, and you can stop once you get to a problem that asks about a different type of cipher.

Or, if you don't want to make an account, the instructor can share screen and show you the Caesar Cipher examples.
