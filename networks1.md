## Humans Love To Connect!

![Circle of Hands](https://content.thriveglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Picture17.png)

## Our need to connect and feel important to someone is as strong as our need to breathe.

### When we have to communicate with technology, it is a natural extension of that ancient need.

### We as people will do all of the technological innovation in the world just to tell mom we love her.

# The History of Humanity

## As a story of connecting

## We told stories that were memorized and passed on from generation to generation.

## We learned to write so we could hand those stories to someone, and deliver them by boat, camel, horse, etc (the first blogs 5400 years ago).

## We shared culture, intentionally and not (the first memes).

## We invented the telegraph (the first electronic communication device).

<h3> Now let's take a look at how people first communicated over a long distance instantaneously </h3>

<h3> The need and desire for fast human interaction is so strong that there was an enormous network developed in just a matter of 
years </h3>

# Week-long Goal:  We're going to build the internet

It all starts with the telegraph and sending any sort of a signal across the wire.  By the end of the week we should see all of the parts of the internet and how it emerges from this first instinct to communicate at a distance.

## ACTIVITY 1: Now we will try to talk to each other using morse(-like) code! Yay so fun!!

Our version of Morse code:

  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/AndyNovo/pen/pogoxpM'>Red Blue Yellow Interdimensional Morse Code</a> by Andy Novocin
  (<a href='https://codepen.io/AndyNovo'>@AndyNovo</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

### Task 1: Encode some words into "heart morse code" 

### Task 2: Receive some words from the chat and decode them

### Task 3: Let's coordinate across the two tracks of camp (Alphabet game)

First the gold track will think of a food that starts with the letter "A" and send it to the blue track using this link, they will reply 
with a food that starts with the letter B.  If we make it to the letter "F" we can move on:

</iframe>

### Task 4: Now, what "protocols" emerged (Heart Morse V1)

How did we figure out how to make our communication more effective between the tracks?  How about your team roles?  

### Task 5: Now to make it tougher, now we're going to communicate using Minecraft

There is a beacon in minecraft.  We're going to try to use it to send our Red, Blue, and Yellow beacon.  Live stream [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/k4L-H18XUqM)

### Task 6: Now what protocols emerged when we tried this in Minecraft
