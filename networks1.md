## Humans Love To Connect!

![Circle of Hands](https://content.thriveglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Picture17.png)

## Our need to connect and feel important to someone is as strong as our need to breathe. 

### When we have to communicate with technology, it is a natural extension of that ancient need.

### We as people will do all of the technological innovation in the world just to tell mom we love her.

# The History of Humanity

## As a story of connecting

## We told stories that were memorized and passed on from generation to generation.

## We learned to write so we could hand those stories to someone, and deliver them by boat, camel, horse, etc (the first blogs 5400 years ago).

## We invented the telegraph (the first electronic communication device).

<h3> Now let's take a look at how people first communicated over a long distance instantaneously </h3>

<h3> The need and desire for fast human interaction is so strong that there was a "network" developed in just a matter of 
1-2 years (even back in 1846)</h3>

### Quickly the cables were intercontinental (1901)

### The Telephone networks grew in a similar fashion (1922)

### By the modern era there are 100s of thousands of MILES of intercontinental wires

# Week-long Goal:  We're going to build the internet

It all starts with the telegraph and sending any sort of a signal across the wire.  By the end of the week we should see all of the parts of the internet and how it emerges from this first instinct to communicate at a distance.

## ACTIVITY 1: Now we will try to talk to each other using morse(-like) code! Yay so fun!!

Our version of Morse code:

  See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/AndyNovo/pen/pogoxpM'>Red Blue Yellow Interdimensional Morse Code</a> by Andy Novocin
  (<a href='https://codepen.io/AndyNovo'>@AndyNovo</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

### Task 1: Encode some words into "heart morse code" 

### Task 2: Receive some words from the chat and decode them

### Task 3: Let's coordinate across the two tracks of camp (Alphabet game)

First the gold track will think of a food that starts with the letter "A" and send it to the blue track using this link, they will reply 
with a food that starts with the letter B.  If we make it to the letter "F" we can move on:

</iframe>

### Task 4: Now, what "protocols" emerged (Heart Morse V1)

How did we figure out how to make our communication more effective between the tracks?  How about your team roles?  

### Task 5: Now to make it tougher, now we're going to communicate using Minecraft

There is a beacon in minecraft.  We're going to try to use it to send our Red, Blue, and Yellow beacon.  Live stream [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/k4L-H18XUqM)

### Task 6: Now what protocols emerged when we tried this in Minecraft

### Task 7: Play "CONCEPT" inside the tracks

Once we're good at that game inside the two tracks then we can play across the two tracks using the beacon.

### Task 8: Play "CONCEPT" across the tracks using Beacons

In this version we aren't networked using the real internet, but each move has an "encoding" using the thread number (3 hearts), sequence number (3 hearts), and picture ID (5 hearts).  This is our first taste of a "wrapper" of the real data.  We have the row and column as separate data from the picture itself, you'll see:
